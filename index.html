			<h3>Who I Am</h3>
			<p class="gap">My name is Derek Hendrick.</p>
			<h3>Bio</h3>
			<p>I'm here at Seattle Central because of my passion for code. I've been messing with programming for over ten years now, first having gotten into it when, as a teenager, a classmate of mine told me about a piece of software his brother used to make a silly video game. I was intrigued, after all, being a 13 year old who spent all his free time playing games, why wouldn't I want to try and make my own? I ended up buying a book on how to use the program, and spent much of my free time studying it, learning the basics of the software, which set me on my path to start learning a programming language. I played around with it for years, ending up with enough skills to create a game for my senior culminating project at the end of my time in High School. After that, I continued messing around with it even longer, gaining some good coding experience before ever attending college.</p>
			<p class="gap">My interest in tech ended up getting me into an illegal IT internship in the mountains of Alaska (it wasn't paid, nor did it offer college credits, and I didn't know,) when I was 19 and 20. I was a little adrift after, just continuing to practice as I drifted between a few different entry level jobs, until I was finally able to afford college. Right now I'm happily living in downtown Seattle, attending classes here at Seattle Central. I spend a lot of my free time still messing with games programming, as well as running games of Dungeons and Dragons, and putting in a lot of time and energy at my managerial position at Dominos in Belltown. Come say hi in the mornings if you get the chance!</p>
			<h3>Skillset and Accomplishments</h3>
			<p>Because of my background in games programming, I'm fairly strong with Object Oriented Programming concepts, data structures, and algorithmic problem solving. I also have some basics down with a few different languages, including HTML, PHP, Python, and Java. I have work on a number of different games under my belt, having created things such as a 2D skeleton based animation system, a high detail character creator and customizer, and a controller gesture based magic system.</p>
			<p>In the realm of development, I'm best at program structuring and debugging.</p>
			<p class="gap">In the realm of development, I'm not as good at database implementation and graphic design.</p>
			<h3>Availability</h3>
			<p class="gap">Truth be told, I'm unsure how well I'll be able to attend class, but I'm hoping to be able to if there will be in person classes. If it'll all be online, then I'll do my best to attend online. I'm typically very busy on the week ends, so it will be difficult to coordinate with me at that time due to work and social obligations.</p>
